# Clevo_N85X_FG_Board
Archived because i no longer have any Clevo laptop.
But this design works fine. Just tie FUSE pin to ground. Also dont forget to switch order of SDA and SCL pins !
I used this design longer than 2 years and i had no stability issues. Just make sure your BQ40z50 or 4050 settings are OK


BQ40z50/BQ4050 Fuel Gauge board for Clevo N850/5/7(Monster A5 V9) notebook computers.

**Issues**
1. Fix reverted SDA SCL 
1. bypass fuse pin
